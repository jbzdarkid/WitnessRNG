  // * 0 represents a square that is satisfied, either because:
  //   * it is outside the region
  //   * (In the normal case) it was inside the region, and has been covered by a polyomino
  //   * (In the cancellation case) it was covered by an equal number of polyominos and onimoylops
  // * -1 represents a square that needs to be covered once (inside the region, or outside but covered by an onimoylop)
  // * -2 represents a square that needs to be covered twice (inside the region & covered by an onimoylop)
  // * And etc, for additional layers of polyominos/onimoylops.
