  // Large pruning optimization -- Attempt to early exit once we cut out a region.
  // Inspired by https://github.com/Overv/TheWitnessSolver
  // For non-pillar puzzles, every time we draw a line from one edge to another, we cut out two regions.
  // We can detect this by asking if we"ve ever left an edge, and determining if we"ve just touched an edge.
  // However, just touching the edge isn"t sufficient, since we could still enter either region.
  // As such, we wait one additional step, to see which half we have moved in to, then we evaluate
  // whichever half you moved away from (since you can no longer re-enter it).
  //
  // Consider this pathway (tracing X-X-X-A-B-C).
  // ....X....
  // . . X . .
  // ....X....
  // . . A . .
  // ...CB....
  //
  // Note that, once we have reached B, the puzzle is divided in half. However, we could go either
  // left or right -- so we don"t know which region is safe to validate.
  // Once we reach C, however, the region to the right is closed off.
  // As such, we can start a flood fill from the cell to the right of A, computed by A+(C-B).
  //
  // Unfortunately, this optimization doesn"t work for pillars, since the two regions are still connected.
  // Additionally, this optimization doesn"t work when custom mechanics are active, as many custom mechanics
  // depend on the path through the entire puzzle
